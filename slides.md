### Build Context
* Use reference sources to build the context for your research question.

[Oxford Bibliographies](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)  
[Credo Reference](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=xreferplus)


### Combine subject terms with keyword searching

* What are subject terms?

* How do I find subject terms?

Strategy 1: Begin with a keyword search, then identify subject terms associated with useful results.

Examples: [JumboSearch](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0&sortby=rank) | [America: History & Life](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AmerHistLife)

Strategy 2: Browse the database's index of subject terms (if available).

Examples: [JumboSearch](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0&sortby=rank) | [America: History & Life](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AmerHistLife)

#### Activity:
* Using [JumboSearch](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0&sortby=rank) or [Historical Abstracts](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=HistAbs), search for keywords or titles that are relevant to your research.
* Select one or two relevant results.
* Identify (and write down) the subject terms used to describe those results.
* Search the database for those subject terms.
* Was this process useful? What worked and what didn't work?

Pro-tip: Library of Congress Subject headings can also be used when searching ["Libraries Worldwide"](https://tufts.on.worldcat.org/discovery) or [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/)


### Find the right kind of primary source to answer your research question

What are examples of primary sources?

How do I find newspapers?

Example: [ProQuest Historical Newspapers: New York Times](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=PQHNNYTimes)

How do I find first-hand travel accounts?

* [Empire Online](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=AMEmpire)
* [Women's Travel Diaries](https://repository.duke.edu/dc/womenstraveldiaries)
* [HathiTrust Digital Library](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=HathiTr)

How do I find maps?

Example: [Library of Congress General Map Collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/general-maps/)

#### Activity
* Identify one or two *kinds* of primary sources that will be useful for your research interests.
* Browse the "Primary Sources" section on the [course guide](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/travel-writing-history).
* Pick a database that contains the kind of primary source you are looking for.
* Search or browse the database according to your research topic.
* What did you find?


### Use Google, but use it wisely

* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous sources.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### Finally...

Ask Questions
* [Chat with a librarian](https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/)
